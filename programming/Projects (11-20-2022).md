tags: blog/not serious?

I find it weird how there's a lot of stuff I want to work with, but because of IDK what, I don't end up sticking to any of them. Just an observation that happens so freaking much.

On the same note, there's a bunch of stuff that I want to achieve over winter break:
- Making a kewl website, while upgrading this one to its own theme and to have more of a blog style.
- Completing the (https://github.com/jose-with-an-accent/stockx-experiments)[[StockX experiments github repo]]. 
- Working on a tool to annotate meetings, and maybe join them.
- Add my notes from Computer Systems in here. Who knows if somebody needs them.
