# Hello World!
This is my space for putting notes, tips, and information on programming. It may include stuff from my own class, in the hopes that it may be useful for someone else. I'm sure there's something cool here... if you look long enough.

There's very little stuff because I'm still building it out. Look at the sidebar to your left.
