## Linked List
A linked list is a list that's stores a memory reference to the next item (or next and previous, if it's a doubly linked list). This is in comparison with normal arrays, which store the next item directly afterwards and have a fixed size, or otherwise need to resize themselves. They can be much better to access, as a normal array might have to copy things after the set size is exceeded. 

## Tree
A tree is a data structure that is formed out of comparisons - the root has at max two nodes, and each has also two.
